# Task 3

### (A)Answer:
The relationship between the 'Faculty' and 'Department' is an association relationship. The navigability of the association indicates that a 'Faculty' object requests services from a 'Department'. And the direction of the association suggests that 'Department' does not know the 'Faculty'. As for the multiplicities, the hollow-diamond adornment on the association indicates that 'Department' is a constituent part of the 'Faculty', where 'Department' can exist independently from the 'Faculty'. The star indicates that a 'Faculty' is associated with several 'Department'.

### (B)Answer:
The relationship between the 'AlarmController' and 'Sensor' is an association relationship. The multiplicities of the association indicates that a 'Sensor' has one 'AlarmController' and an 'AlarmController' is associated with one or more 'Sensor'.
